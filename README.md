# Arkanoid-Game
Welcome to my implementation of the classic Arkanoid game done as a project in a programming course I took at Bar-Ilan university, developed using Java with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming principles. This project serves as an exploration of advanced programming techniques such as inheritance and event handling through listeners.

## About
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a gui friendly platform. I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE,
using the following OOP principals:

- Polymorphism and Inheritance.
- Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, inheritance, etc.
- Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
- Working with GUI.

## Instructions
- Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle.
- Press 'p' to pause.
- Press 'Space' to re-enter the game.
- Pop all the blocks and progress through the game until victory or lose and try again :)
- You can enter levels as arguments and the game will be played on those levels only

## How to Play the Arkanoid Game
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed.
- IntelliJ IDEA: The game is developed using IntelliJ.
### Setup
```console
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/tomerp1812/Arkanoid-Game.git


# Go into the repository.
cd Arkanoid-Game

# Add the biuoop Library
# In IntelliJ, go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries.
# Click the + symbol and choose Java.
# Navigate to the Arkanoid-Game folder and select the biuoop-1.4.jar file to add it to your project.
```
